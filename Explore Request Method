What Are HTTP Request Methods?
An HTTP request is an action to be performed on a resource identified by a given Request-URL. Request methods are case-sensitive, always noted 
in upper case.

How Do HTTP Requests Work?
HTTP requests work as the intermediary transportation method between a client/application and a server. The client submits an HTTP request to 
the server, and after processing, the server sends back a response. The response contains status information about the request.


There are various HTTP request methods, but each one is assigned a specific purpose. Let's start -
1. GET Method -
GET method is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server.
A GET request is often used to typically fetch json data from the server, there are different formats by which you can retrieve the data -

XML
HTML
Text
JSON

2. POST method -
Another popular HTTP request method is POST. In web communication, POST requests are utilized to send data to a server to create or update a 
resource. The HTTP POST method is often used to send user-generated data to a server. One example is when a user uploads a profile photo.
