Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. In other words, it is a 
way to destroy the unused objects.

Advantage of Garbage Collection
It makes java memory efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts.

How can an object be unreferenced?
1.By nulling the reference
2.By assigning a reference to another
3.By anonymous object etc.
