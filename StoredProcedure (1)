What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call
it to execute it.
You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter 
value(s) that is passed.
