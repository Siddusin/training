 Network Protocol driver
The Network Protocol driver uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly 
into the vendor-specific database protocol. It is fully written in java.

Advantage:
No client side library is required because of application server that can perform many tasks like auditing, 
load balancing, logging etc.

Disadvantages:
Network support is required on client machine.
Requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.
Maintenance of Network Protocol driver becomes costly because it requires database-specific coding to be done in 
the middle tier.
