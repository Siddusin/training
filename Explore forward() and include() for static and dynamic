Static include

This is a process to include the content of a file into a jsp. The include file can be a jsp, html or txt file. This inclusion happens during 
the conversion of jsp into the servlet. This is required to avoid duplicate code in multiple jsp. If a common task is required to be performed 
by a set of jsp files then that code can be written in a file and that file can be included in the required jsp. This can be done by using name 
of the include file into the file attribute of include directive. This directive can be used in any place and any number of times in a jsp.

Forwarding request

Using <jsp:forward>

This tag transfers request available to a jsp to another page or a jsp. The second page can use the request available to the first jsp. It also 
transfers the execution control to the second page. The execution control never comes back to the first jsp. Hence, the code present after this 
tag cannot execute.
