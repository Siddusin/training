The non-relational database, or NoSQL database, stores data. However, unlike the relational database, there are 
no tables, rows, primary keys or foreign keys.  Instead, the non-relational database uses a storage model 
optimized for specific requirements of the type of data being stored.

Some of the more popular NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase and Apache HBase.

There are four popular non-relational types: document data store, column-oriented database, key-value store and 
graph database.  Often combinations of these types are used for a single application.

Document data stores
A document data store manages a set of named string fields and object data values in an entity referred to as a “
document” typically stored in the form of JSON documents, which can be encoded in a variety of ways, including 
XML, YAML, JSON, BSON or as plain text. The fields within documents are exposed, allowing an application to query
and filter data using field values.

The document stores do not require all documents to maintain identical data structures, which provides a great 
deal of flexibility.  It’s easy to see then how this flexibility can be leveraged as an organization’s 
requirements change.

Columnar (or column oriented) data stores
A columnar data store organizes data into columns, which is conceptually similar to the relational database. The 
true advantage of a column-family database is in its denormalized approach to structuring sparse data, which 
comes from its column-oriented approach to storing data.

relational database;
A relational database, also called Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) or SQL database, stores data in 
tables and rows also referred to as records. The term “relational database” was first used in 1970 by E.F. Codd 
at IBM in his research paper “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.” Historically, the most 
popular relational databases have been Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MySQL and IBM DB2. Several free 
versions of these RDBMS platforms have gained popularity over the years, such as SQL Server Express, PostgreSQL,
 SQLite, MySQL and MariaDB.

A relational database works by linking information from multiple tables through the use of “keys.” A key is a unique identifier which can be assigned to a row of data contained within a table. This unique identifier, called a “primary key,” can then be included in a record located in another table when that record has a relationship to the primary record in the main table. When this unique primary key is added to a record in another table, it is called a “foreign key” in the associated table. The connection between the primary and foreign key then creates the “relationship” between records contained across multiple tables.
