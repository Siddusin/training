In general, both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the 
differences between the two
  1.The main difference between the .equals() method and == operator is that one is a method and the other is the operator.
  2.We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison. 
    In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values 
    in the objects.
  3.If a class does not override the equals method, then by default it uses the equals(Object o) method of the closest parent class that
    has overridden this method. See this for detail
