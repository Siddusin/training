1.URI (uniform resource identifier) identifies a resource (text document, image file, etc)

Contains information about how to fetch a resource from its location. For example:

http://example.com/mypage.html
ftp://example.com/download.zip
mailto:user@example.com
file:///home/user/file.txt
http://example.com/resource?foo=bar#fragment
/other/link.html (A relative URL, only useful in the context of another URL)
URLs always start with a protocol (http) and usually contain information such as the network host name (example.com) 
and often a document path (/foo/mypage.html). URLs may have query parameters and fragment identifiers.


2.URL (uniform resource locator) is a subset of the URIs that include a network location

Identifies a resource by name. It always starts with the prefix urn: For example:

urn:isbn:0451450523 to identify a book by its ISBN number.
urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66 a globally unique identifier
urn:publishing:book - An XML namespace that identifies the document as a type of book.
URNs can identify ideas and concepts. They are not restricted to identifying documents. When a URN does represent a document, 
it can be translated into a URL by a "resolver". The document can then be downloaded from the URL.


3.URN (uniform resource name) is a subset of URIs that include a name within a given space, but no location

URIs encompasses both URLs, URNs, and other ways to indicate a resource.

An example of a URI that is neither a URL nor a URN would be a data URI such as data:,Hello%20World. It is not a URL or URN because the
URI contains the data. It neither names it, nor tells you how to locate it over the network.

There are also uniform resource citations (URCs) that point to meta data about a document rather than to the document itself. An example of 
a URC would be an indicator for viewing the source code of a web page: view-source:http://example.com/. A URC is another type of URI that is 
neither URL nor URN.
