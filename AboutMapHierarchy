A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.

A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.

Java Map Hierarchy
There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, and three classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap. 
A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values. HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap 
doesn't allow any null key or value.

A Map can't be traversed, so you need to convert it into Set using keySet() or entrySet() method.
HashMap	HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order.
LinkedHashMap	LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.
TreeMap	TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap. It maintains ascending order.
