Port 8080 may be either http or https depending on how the server is configured, however it is more commonly setup as http. By default, 
HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443, but a URL like http://www.example.com:8080/path/ specifies that the web browser connects instead to
port 8080 of the HTTP server.
