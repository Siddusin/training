Multiprocessing – A computer using more than one CPU at a time.
Multitasking – Tasks sharing a common resource (like 1 CPU).
Multithreading is an extension of multitasking.


MultiTasking
1.	The execution of more than one task simultaneously is known as multitasking.
2.	The number of CPU is one.
3.	It takes moderate amount of time.
4.	In this, one by one job is being executed at a time
5.	It is economical.
6.	The number of users is more than one.
7.	Throughput is moderate.
8.	Its efficiency is moderate.
9.	It is of two types: Single user multitasking and Multiple user multitasking.
10.	Number of user tasks is more than one.

Multiprocessing
1.The availability of more than one processor per system, that can execute several set of instructions in 
  parallel is known as multiprocessing.
2.The number of CPUs is more than one.
3.It takes less time for job processing.
4.In this, more than one process can be executed at a time.
5.It is economical.
6.The number of users is can be one or more than one.
7.Throughput is maximum.
8.Its efficiency is maximum.
9.It is of two types: Symmetric Multiprocessing and Asymmetric Multiprocessing. 
10.Number of user tasks can be one or more than one.

MultiThreading
1.A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization. 
2. Multi threading is an execution model that allows a single process to have multiple code segments
3.Multi threading is the ability of a process to manage its use by more than one user at a time and to manage
  multiple requests by the same user without having to have multiple copies of the program.
