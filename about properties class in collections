Properties is a subclass of Hashtable. It is used to maintain lists of values in which the key is a String and 
the value is also a String.
The Properties class is used by many other Java classes. For example, it is the type of object returned by System.
getProperties( ) when obtaining environmental values.
Properties define the following instance variable. This variable holds a default property list associated with a 
Properties object.

String getProperty(String key)

Returns the value associated with the key. A null object is returned if the key is neither in the list nor in the default property list.

2	
String getProperty(String key, String defaultProperty)

Returns the value associated with the key; defaultProperty is returned if the key is neither in the list nor in the default property list.

3	
void list(PrintStream streamOut)

Sends the property list to the output stream linked to streamOut.

4	
void list(PrintWriter streamOut)

Sends the property list to the output stream linked to streamOut.

5	
void load(InputStream streamIn) throws IOException

Inputs a property list from the input stream linked to streamIn.

6	
Enumeration propertyNames( )

Returns an enumeration of the keys. This includes those keys found in the default property list, too.

7	
Object setProperty(String key, String value)

Associates value with the key. Returns the previous value associated with the key, or returns null if no such association exists.

8	
void store(OutputStream streamOut, String description)

After writing the string specified by description, the property list is written to the output stream linked to streamOut.
