Diff between pull and fetch 

git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the 
latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn’t do any file
 transferring. It’s more like just checking to see if there are any
 changes available).

git pull on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes
 from the remote repository.

diff between git merge and git rebase

Merging is a common practice in Git used to integrate changes from 
one branch to another. Git merge is a command that commits changes
to another location. It allows developers to take their independent 
lines of code created by the Git branch and integrate them into a 
single branch. This only changes the target branch while the history 
of the source branch remains. Git rebase is yet another command used 
basically for the same purpose except it does it quite differently. 
They both do the same thing – incorporate commits from one branch 
into another – but the difference lies in how they do it.
