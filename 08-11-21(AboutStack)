The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector 
to be treated as a stack. The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to 
test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
When a stack is first created, it contains no items.

Methods
boolean	empty()
Tests if this stack is empty.
E	peek()
Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack.
E	pop()
Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function.
E	push(E item)
Pushes an item onto the top of this stack.
int	search(Object o)
Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack.
