A Factory Design Pattern is used when the entire object can be easily created and object is not very complex. Whereas Builder Pattern is used 
when the construction process of a complete object is very complex.
Another difference is if we want to add another object into Factory, we need to modify the factory method- violates open close principle 
(close for modification and open for extension). Whereas, if want to add another car builder we can just create another builder and no change in
director class as director constructor accept all buildersâ€“ Extensible.
